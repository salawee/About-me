## ‚ö° **Fuel Consumption Forecasting for U.S. Electricity Generation**

### üîç **Overview**
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of fuel consumption forecasting in the United States, spanning from 2015 to 2022. By employing advanced statistical models such as **STL decomposition**, **ETS**, and **ARIMA**, I aim to provide robust predictions of future energy demand, focusing on the consumption of natural gas, coal, petroleum coke, and petroleum liquids. This work supports **policymakers**, **industry stakeholders**, and **academic researchers** by delivering insights into energy trends and helping to promote sustainable energy management.

### Key Highlights:
- **Methodology**: Time-series analysis, seasonality and trend decomposition, autocorrelation analysis, and various forecasting models.
- **Results**: High accuracy forecasts, especially using the **ETS** model for natural gas consumption (RMSE: 20,687.46) and **STL** for coal consumption (RMSE: 5,936.20).
- **Impact**: This project provides actionable insights for strategic energy planning and demonstrates the value of applying machine learning to real-world energy problems.

## ü©∫ **Predictive Analytics for Early Detection of Diabetes**

### üîç **Overview**
This project leverages the **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)** dataset to develop predictive models aimed at early detection of diabetes. The objective is to build models capable of identifying individuals at risk of diabetes or prediabetes based on key health indicators such as **BMI**, **physical activity**, and **blood pressure**. I utilized a variety of machine learning techniques, including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forests**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, to deliver accurate and reliable predictions.

### Key Highlights:
- **Model Building**: Developed models to classify individuals into diabetic, prediabetic, or non-diabetic categories.
- **Feature Selection**: Employed techniques to reduce the number of input variables while maintaining model accuracy.
- **Results**: **Random Forests** showed the highest overall accuracy with an **AUC** of 0.8044, while **Logistic Regression** provided 86.33% accuracy, making it a simpler yet effective model.
- **Impact**: This project demonstrates how machine learning can enhance early detection of chronic diseases and support public health initiatives focused on **early intervention** and **preventative care**.
